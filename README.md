# Rules
--- Wins, Losses, and Ties ---


In blackjack, the cards are valued as follows:

An Ace can count as either 1 or 11, as explained below.
The cards from 2 through 9 are valued at their face value.
The 10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.

Once the hand is over, how does the dealer decide which bets to pay, and which bets to collect?

If you draw a card that makes your hand total go over 21, your hand is a bust. That is an automatic loser. The dealer will immediately collect your bet, and discard your hand.

Assuming you did not bust, the dealer will play out his hand at the end. If he busts by going over 21, all the remaining players win their bets.

If neither you nor the dealer busted, now the dealer will compare his final total to yours.

If his total is higher than yours, you lose the bet, and he will collect your bet and put the chips in his tray.

If your total is higher than his, you win the bet, and he will pay the entire amount you have bet. After he pays you, you’ll have your initial bet plus the amount you won in the circle.

So, what happens if you and the dealer tie, with the same exact total? Nothing at all. A tie is called a “push”, and you do not win or lose your bet. Your chips stay in the betting circle where you can leave them for the next hand if you want, or you can add to or remove from them as you wish before the next hand.
